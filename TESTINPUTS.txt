Python 3.8.1rc1 is now available for testing
Python 3.8.1rc1 is the release candidate of the first maintenance release of Python 3.8.

The Python 3.8 series is the newest feature release of the Python language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. You can find Python 3.8.1rc1 here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381rc1/

Assuming no critical problems are found prior to 2019-12-16, the scheduled release date for 3.8.1 as well as Ned Deily's birthday, no code changes are planned between this release candidate and the final release.

That being said, please keep in mind that this is a pre-release of 3.8.1 and as such its main purpose is testing.

See the - What's New in Python 3.8 - document for more information about features included in the 3.8 series. Detailed information about all changes made in 3.8.0 can be found in its change log.

Maintenance releases for the 3.8 series will continue at regular bi-monthly intervals, with 3.8.2 planned for February 2020.
  
We hope you enjoy Python 3.8!
